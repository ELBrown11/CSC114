# CSC114 - Computer Science I
I'm currently taking a Computer Science I course  at Delaware Technical Community College <br/>
and these are some of the programs I've created so far.

## Assignment #1
* **task:** create a program which computes tax and tips for a bill of a specific amount. <br/>
  In this case the amount was $88.67.
## Assignment #2
* **task:** create a program which uses a given recipe that makes 48 cookies based on a <br/>
  ratio of 3 ingredients and make a program which ask the user how many cookies they <br/>
  want to make and then displays how much of each of the 3 ingredients with be needed.
## Assignment #3
* **task:** create a program which calculates the user's bank service fees for a month based <br/>
  on...number of checks deposited, current balance, and general bank fees
## Assignment #4
* **task:** create a program that takes speed of a vehicle and hours traveled (via user input) <br/>
  and outputs a table with the distance traveled every hour
## Assignment #5
* **task:** create a program that takes a range of temperatures and converts then to celcius <br/>
 from farenheit or vice versa depending on user selection. The range should print the original <br/>
 temperatures  to the right and print the converted on the left side of the table.<br/>
 
 
 Celcius | Farenheit
------------ | -------------
temp1 | temp1 convert
...    |...
temp2   | temp2 convert

### OR
 Farenheit | Celcius
------------ | -------------
temp1 | temp1 convert
...    |...
temp2   | temp2 convert
